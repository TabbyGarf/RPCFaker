RPCFaker is an application used to manage processes to fake a Discord Rich Presence, sourced from the official [Discord Detectable Applications API](https://discord.com/api/v9/applications/detectable) similarly to [markterence's Discord Quest Completer](markterence/discord-quest-completer)

You can either use the script directly by cloning the repo and downloading the requirements or if you don't have Python installed and don't want to bother, you can use the executable in the [latest releases section](https://github.com/TabbyGarf/RPCFaker/releases).
